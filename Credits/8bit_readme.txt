This is not a game, but a set of graphics I made for... well, anyone who might want a set of 8-bit-style graphics.  They were made using something pretty much identical to the actual NES palette and following NES-like color restrictions (only 4 colors per tile/sprite including the transparency -- hence the battle backgrounds being black everywhere but the top, similarly to the NES Final Fantasy games.)

Each individual sprite, tileset, and background has been uploaded and added to one of the "Free Graphics" pages of the OHRRPGCE wiki (www.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce) for those who want to mix-and-match graphics or just leave out certain ones that they don't have a use for.  The basic "8bit.rpg" file includes all of the graphics, the NES master palette I used, a bunch of small example maps I used to fiddle around with the tilesets and for screenshot purposes, and some "default" weapons made to demonstrate how the handle positions for the various weapon types are set up.  Could be convenient for someone who likes the graphics but doesn't want to take the time to import everything one by one, I suppose.

The newly-added "8bit+layers.rpg" is the same thing, but with the maptiles built with the use of layers in mind (unlike the original version, which was intended to make simpler non-layered maps along the lines of the classic NES RPGs.)  This makes it possible to mix-and-match tiles more than the original version allowed, and also includes a few additional tiles that weren't present in the original version due to lack of space (mostly recolors of existing
tiles, though a few oddball new/edited tiles like the potted plants and Pub signs are present here and there.)
It's very easy to end up using many, many layers with these tilesets, but with the OHRRPGCE supporting up to 16
layers now that shouldn't be a problem.

All graphics are made entirely by Eddie Lee (FnrrfYgmSchnish) with one exception -- the wereraccoon hero sprite, which was edited (with permission) from the one made by Nathan Karr.

Feel free to use these graphics in your own games -- use them as-is, edit them, change their palettes, whatever.  Pretty much anything is okay, so long as you give me credit for the original graphics.  I may even consider adding sprites to the set in the future if I get enough requests (this is actually how I ended up adding spears to the
set -- a random message from Virtuous Sword on Slime Salad came through one day a while back asking if I was
going to add more weapons, with spears being the example listed.  Some weeks or months later I randomly feel like
working on 8-bit graphics again and remembered the request for more weapons... so they were the first thing I added
in for this update!)
