* Title Theme Major and Title Theme were recorded by yours truly, combining the Gregorian chant “Adoro Te Devote” (or it transposed into minor, respectively) 
  with chords underneath. Credit goes to the program Audacity (https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) for allowing me to remove the background noise generated by the 
  pipe organ I was playing on.

* All other music comes from https://www.musopen.org/ and is in the Public Domain. All songs have information on the Artist and whatnot displayed, either as it 
  was originally filled in by Musopen, or added in by me, to make finding the right song easier for you.

* Audacity was also used on those songs, to remove the silence at the beginning and end of them.

* Sound Effects have all been taken from FreeSound.org. Any necessary attributions are listed below.

* The sound used for text boxes was uploaded by a user named SomeGuy22, and can be found at ​https://freesound.org/people/SomeGuy22/sounds/431327/.
  Its volume was reduced using Audacity, so that it would make a pleasant, unobstrusive noise.

* Many other sound effects come from one EVRetro's "Video Game Noises" pack. It can be found at https://freesound.org/people/EVRetro/packs/27845/.
