# To make a footnote, all you need to do is create a block with the same name as a block of 
# text in texts.vili, and then put a table of strings in that. Then, in the text you want a
# footnote for, simply end a line with "FNXX >" (this, of course, means that that line will
# be a button presser). Thence, the footnote will take the reader to the XX'th string in
# the aforementioned table, allowing for many footnotes to the one block of text.
